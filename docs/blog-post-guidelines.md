4. **Impact analysis** - How this affects existing applications
5. **Action items** - What readers should do next
6. **Resources** - Links to documentation, GitHub issues, discussions

### Code Examples
- Use syntax highlighting for Ruby/ERB/JavaScript
- Include both before/after examples for changes
- Test all code snippets before publishing
- Provide context for Stimulus controllers and Turbo frames
- Show Hotwire-specific implementations when relevant

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify information from official sources (GitHub, Rails blog, ruby-lang.org)
- Cross-reference with Rails Guides and API documentation
- Include links to relevant pull requests and issues
- Fact-check version compatibility claims
